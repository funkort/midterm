components - potentiometer - red, yellow, blue, green LED lights - arduino uno board

description - this is a music responsive "party box." the lights correspond to different frequencies in the song and flash when that part of the song is played. the potentiometer controls the volume and the width of the equalizer. i chose this project because i love imaging sound.
